Project page: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">Project: Etch-a-Sketch</a>

Since i have a background in architecture and i spent the last decade working with CAD and design software, i tried to make the interface look like one, this is a project i plan to continue working on to add new drawing tools as i progress the Odin Project more advanced HTML-CSS courses, and the usage of libraries as i found really interesting ones.
